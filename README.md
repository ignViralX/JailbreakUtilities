This repository contains simple API wrappers and other tools for developing applications for the Jailbreak game. Coded entirely in Python utilizing JSON for storage. You can utilize this in programs like private discord bots for your crew to use and be more informed about the state of the game, or a website displaying leaderboards; whatever you want! Everything here is licensed under the MIT license so you may take and use whatever you'd like as long as your project is open-source aswell :)

**NOTE:** The latest vehicle additions, the Carbonara (limited) and Frostcrawler (seasonal), do not yet appear to be in the API. They will be added to this repositories static lists once they are added in the next monthly trading API refresh.

## Quick Start

The only required installations to utilize this repository is `python3`

This repository contains standalone wrappers and tools that can be directly copied and pasted into your own code and function seamlessly. They are built to function just out of their file and do not have any other hard file dependencies, thus making it great for finding inspiration or just getting quick code excerpts.

## Features

- API wrappers for Trading and Crew Leaderboards API
- Premade lists for things like every item in the game
- Simple code that can be built upon in other applications
- Example discord embed integrations for wrappers
- Documentation (coming soon)
- Updates with new dataset releases from Jailbreak developers

## Miscellaneous

This project is in no way associated with Jailbreak or any of its developers; this is a 3rd party API wrapper & utility toolset developed by ignViral for other developers to use in their applications. Created in June 2023, updated & made public in December 2023. Latest update `1/25/2023`; lists & functionality is kept up-to-date with the latest API releases and game changes.
