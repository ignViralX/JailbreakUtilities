This repository contains simple API wrappers and other tools for developing applications for the Roblox Jailbreak game. Coded entirely in Python utilizing JSON for storage. You can utilize this in programs like private discord bots for your crew to use and be more informed about the state of the game, or a website displaying leaderboards; whatever you want! Everything here is completely unlicensed and free for anyone to use without attribution (though it is always appreciated)!

**NOTE:** Jailbreak updates its API every month, so new items or vehicles may not display for a few weeks. These wrappers automatically pull and cache the API, so no changes on your end are needed to get new items as soon as they are available.

## Quick Start

The only dependency required to use the wrappers is `python3`

This repository contains standalone wrappers and tools that can be directly copied and pasted into your own code and function seamlessly. They are built to function just out of their file and do not have any other hard file dependencies, thus making it great for finding inspiration or just getting quick code excerpts.

## Features

- API wrappers for Trading and Crew Leaderboards API
- Simple code that can be built upon in other applications
- Example discord embed integrations for wrappers
- Automatically updates with the Jailbreak API
- Estimated trading value API wrappers (JBValues)

## Miscellaneous

This project is in no way associated with Roblox Jailbreak or any of its developers; this is a 3rd party API wrapper & utility toolset developed by ignViral for other developers to use in their applications. Created in June 2023, updated & made public in December 2023. Latest update `12/26/2025`; all wrappers are automatically kept up-to-date with the latest API releases and game changes.
